# GymBeam

The objective of the case study is to process a dump of GymBeam’s product descriptions from a
CSV file, and perform a textual and sentiment analysis.

Download the [CSV file](https://gist.github.com/derror/24b62116c54d4c18d99b5c3527590d54) containing a dump of GymBeam’s product descriptions.

Write code to:

1. Find the most positive and the most negative product description of selected GymBeam
   products. Print/render the product names and descriptions.
2. Then, find the top 10 most frequently used words in product descriptions. Skip one-word
   conjunctions (and, but, or, for, nor, yet, so). Print/render the words.

In your code, use a public API or any 3rd-party library to determine the sentiment of a given text.
The sentiment score tells you whether the text is more positive or negative.

Use programming language for the role you are applying for.

Do not use any framework.
